# SSBM Stats Twitter Bot

This bot operates of a small dataset pulled from the Tafostats data. It can answer questions such as the following:

- Marth vs Fox on Pokemon Stadium
- Falcon vs Sheik
- What's Falco's best counterpick vs puff?

This bot isn't currently running 24/7 as the subset of data it operates on is quite small, and I don't want it get too much usage without first backing it up with a bigger and more comprehensive dataset. If you've got a different solution to getting more matchup data other than scraping Tafostats, hit me up!
